<p>I get a lot of questions about working with LLMs. Something I hear people discussing a lot is whether AI-generated code is
better, or worse, or just more evil than human-generated code. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an either/or question. To me, it&rsquo;s just another tool:
like most tools, there are ways to use them for good, or as weapons.</p>
<p>I think vibe coding is great if you need to write a one-off script that isn&rsquo;t intended to be
part of production code. For example, I asked Claude to help me come up with ways to generate
fairly large test data sets for my last project, and it decided to write me a script to do it.
This worked beautifully for what I needed, and saved me a ton of time.
I did have to iterate on the prompt a bit to get it to do what I wanted,
and that was a little nerve-wracking, so I saved off the different versions of the code
(because sure enough, sometimes it got worse in ways I didn’t expect).</p>

          <p>I’ve been doing a lot of work around grief lately.</p>
<p>Both of my parents died in 2023. Two other friends also died in 2023 - both former coworkers. One was in his mid-thirties and had a rare brain tumor; the other died from COVID. </p>
<p>My dad’s death last June came after several months in the ICU. He endured repeated rounds of dialysis, which he hated, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, which I hadn’t heard of before. He had opted for open-heart surgery, I think because he didn’t fully understand the risks given that he was a cancer patient for over 10 years, and like many people, believed that doctors are superheroes. I was with him, and held his hand when they turned off the machines at his request. </p>

<p><em>Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead.</em></p>
<p>&mdash;- Morihei Ueshiba</p></blockquote>
<p>I started studying aikido about 12 years ago, shortly after I moved to San Francisco.
I had no idea how much I would enjoy it, or how much it would change my life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what it was when I first started, but the translation I like the best is &ldquo;Path of
Life Harmony.&rdquo;</p>
