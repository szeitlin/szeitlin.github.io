<h2 id="give-that-story-a-little-more-plot">Give that story a little more plot!</h2>

<p>First, I used seaborn to make two histograms of the average speed, and plot them together in two different colors. Thankfully, the <a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html">seaborn tutorial</a> had exactly the right example for me to follow, but I&rsquo;m going to explain a few things that were not obvious to me.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Calculate the range for the binning</strong></p>

<p>If you have more than one data set, this is done by concatenating the dataframes so you can treat the data as one big one.</p>

<p>To do this, the example in the seaborn tutorial used this odd little thing called r_. I didn&rsquo;t know what that was, so I did some digging and found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18601001/numpy-r-is-not-a-function-what-is-it">this post</a> the most useful. I&rsquo;ll probably be able to remember it now that I know that it&rsquo;s similar to how slicing works in R.</p>

<p>The actual bins come from using linspace to create an array of linearly spaced points.</p>

<p>The normed=True argument is good here because I didn&rsquo;t want to worry about the size of the distributions (I knew they weren&rsquo;t the same).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Show your colors!</strong></p>

<p>I had to look up what the colors were, because in the tutorial they don&rsquo;t tell you, and it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me from the hex code, which color was which dataset. I also didn&rsquo;t know that you can add the label to the same command where you chose the data set, because initially the legend didn&rsquo;t show up at all.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I had to add this ridiculously complicated (typical matplotlib) line to tell it to put the legend to the right a little bit. Otherwise who knows if there is a legend, because it is invisible.</p>

<p>At the end of all that, I was pretty happy with how this plot turned out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that the suburb plot is relatively gaussian with little bit of a tail to the left.
What surprised me was how high the average speeds were, even on the relatively short city rides.
Personally, I don&rsquo;t like to ride that fast in the city, because most of the time it is too scary and/or impossible with traffic.
But the timestamps give a little more insight into why that&rsquo;s not always impossible (more on that in <a href="https://szeitlin.github.io/posts/biking_data/biking-data-from-xml-to-plots-part-4/">part 4</a>).</p>
