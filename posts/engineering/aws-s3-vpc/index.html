        <p>To make a long, mostly whiny story short, as part of my current role,
I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of fighting with AWS to help support my team.</p>

<p>Some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned along the way are probably not obvious if you, like me, are relying
mostly on AWS docs and other people&rsquo;s advice, so I thought I&rsquo;d collect some of them here.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Best practices for storing big data on S3</strong></p>

<p>___<em>Think about your bucket structure</em></p>

<p>One of the things I ran into in my previous role was how hard it can be
to find a specific file in s3 if your file naming isn&rsquo;t set up to make this easy.</p>

<p>Although S3 is not a real filesystem, you can almost treat it like one, but it can take a little
bit of finagling to write your code to help with this issue.</p>

<p>So I recommend against, for example, putting dates in your filenames, like so:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t do this: <em>s3://mybucket/2018-12-02_server-1_file-1.csv</em></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario: let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for a specific file from server 13 on Nov 12th.
But you can&rsquo;t grep for it because the file naming conventions changed at some point
and nobody&rsquo;s sure what the structure was at this particular point in time.</p>

<p>In order to make sure it exists, find out how big it is, and copy it to your machine,
you now have to list your <em>entire</em> bucket.</p>

<p>This is going to take a while. Like, probably minutes if your
data has been accumulating for a few years, especially if you have a lot of files.</p>

<p>In fact, the list
might be so long that you won&rsquo;t be able to scroll through it all, you might have to write it out
to a file and then search through that.</p>

<p>I say this from experience, having worked with legacy log files that were stored this way.</p>

<hr />

<p>___<em>Coalesce</em></p>

<p>I recommend against using whatever the default output is, if you&rsquo;re writing out from a cluster,
for example, with something like spark.</p>

<p>Most cluster systems will by default write out 1 file per partition or node,
which means you end up with a gazillion tiny files of different sizes and it rarely makes sense for
any downstream usage.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend grouping, coalescing, and compressing your files.</p>

<p>___<em>Add slashes into your filenames.</em></p>

<p>This (artifically) groups your files by year, month, and day.</p>

<p>Then you can coalesce them down into, say, 1 file per day or per hour
(depending on how much data you have).</p>

<p><strong>I recommend a structure more like this:</strong> <em>s3://mybucket/2018/12/02/platform_name/file-1.gz</em></p>

<p>Now, when you list your bucket, you can easily jump to the date and platform you want, and
download a minimum number of files that meet your criteria.</p>

<hr />

<p>___<em>Think about your bucket policies and locations</em></p>

<p>Although new S3 buckets are now global, up until very recently they were restricted to certain regions for a variety
of reasons - availability, price, and latency are the main ones.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re working with legacy buckets, remember that some AWS services will still restrict access if you don&rsquo;t
pass the correct region to go with the bucket (ask me how I know this after spending a couple of days
tracking down an AccessDenied error from EC2&hellip;).</p>

<p>Until recently, setting up strict bucket policies was sort of optional, but thanks to another recent change
in security measures, now you&rsquo;ll have to set explicit policies or you&rsquo;re going to find yourself
locked out of your own buckets.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that if you use any kind of encryption, if you&rsquo;re trying to access those buckets from
another account, you have to use custom KMS keys,
and create an IAM role that has access to your encryption keys.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Some things I learned about VPCs</strong></p>

<p>As part of the Pachyderm setup (see separate post about that),
I had to set up a connection to our Redshift instance, which
lives on a separate account from our kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>I tried following the instructions in the AWS docs, because it seemed pretty straightforward, but
as with my experience trying to set up cross-account access for EMR (see separate post about that),
it just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Again, I couldn&rsquo;t
figure out why because I wasn&rsquo;t getting any useful feedback like error messages or logs that could
point me toward what I was missing.</p>

<p>After a lot of digging around in docs and asking for help from a variety of people online,
I finally found someone who was willing to help me troubleshoot (thanks, Drew Davies!).</p>

<p>What I ended up having to do was set up a new, custom VPC for Redshift.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hint 1: AWS doesn&rsquo;t really want you to use the default VPC for anything.</em></strong></p>

<p>It seems like the default VPC is there mostly as a way to make it easy to get started prototyping,
but for production it&rsquo;s of limited utility because there are a lot of features that
just don&rsquo;t work with the default VPC. (In this regard, it&rsquo;s similar
to how they won&rsquo;t let you use default encryption on s3 with cross-account access.)</p>

<p>So to solve my problem, I had to create a new VPC for Redshift,
update the IAM roles, and redeploy Redshift inside the new VPC. All of that worked as described
in the AWS docs.</p>

<p>Then I had to create the peering connection,
create new security groups,
and add the CIDR blocks to the routing tables.</p>

<p>The AWS docs were ok for getting me this far. I had to do a bit of reading about CIDR blocks.</p>

<p>Then I logged into the kubernetes cluster and tried to access the database, but it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hint 2: You have to turn on DNS resolution for the peering connection.</em></strong></p>

<p>Finally, with Drew&rsquo;s help, we figured out that I needed to
go into a hidden menu and click a box for DNS resolution on the peering connection.
I had to do this on <em>both accounts</em>.</p>

<p>Then I had to wait a while before it propagated.</p>

<p>This is another thing that&rsquo;s frustrating about AWS - they
don&rsquo;t do a great job of telling you what you can expect might happen instantaneously vs. what might take
a few minutes.</p>

<p>This was all poorly documented and I genuinely don&rsquo;t understand why it&rsquo;s not the default
when you&rsquo;re setting up a peering connection between two VPCs.</p>

<p>After all that, I heard another friend struggling with the same problem, which is why I wanted to write
this up. Sorry it took so long for me to publish it!</p>
