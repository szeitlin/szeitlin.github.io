        <p><em>The scene:</em></p>

<p>I needed to process data from an s3 bucket using pyspark.
 The s3 bucket was owned by a different account.
 I had done this before.
 But this time, there was a twist: we needed to encrypt the data
 because of GDPR requirements.
 At the end of the processing, I needed to
 save the results to another s3 bucket for loading into Redshift.</p>

<p>Thus began a weeks-long saga of learning about AWS the hard way.</p>

<p>(Disclaimer: I am not a devops person. I&rsquo;ve learned about infrastructure
 only because I wanted to be able to handle my own data pipelining.)</p>

<p>The first thing you need to know about AWS, which I had never realized before
 really being forced to understand how it all works,
 is that everything in AWS makes more sense if you think about it from
 the perspective of security requirements. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense if you
 think about how you would use the services. It&rsquo;s not set up to be easy
 to use. It&rsquo;s set up to be so secure it&rsquo;s almost unusable.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here&rsquo;s some background information, before I get into the
 stuff I learned the hard way.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Services used:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>S3:  Simple Storage Service, where the input data and scripts are stored, and where the results will be saved</p></li>

<li><p>IAM: Identity and Access Management, the role management service that controls access for users and services</p></li>

<li><p>KMS: Key Management Service, which controls encryption and access to the s3 bucket</p></li>

<li><p>EC2: Elastic Cloud Compute, the AWS hosted machines that form the EMR cluster</p></li>

<li><p>EMR: Elastic Map Reduce, the service that runs the spark job</p></li>

<li><p>STS: Security Token Service, the token system that allows a user or role to assume another role or temporary credentials to access a service</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Accounts used:</strong></p>

<p>1) BucketOwner account</p>

<p>2) EMROwner account</p>

<p><img src="/AWS_diagram_anonymized.png" alt="summary diagram" /></p>

<p><strong>Local configuration:</strong>
I already knew how to configure my local machine to let me have multiple profiles, but if you haven&rsquo;t
done this before, here&rsquo;s the TL;DR:</p>

<p>On my local machine, I have separate profiles I’m using to access the s3 bucket
directly on the BucketOwner account, and to launch the script that
starts the EMR cluster and runs the spark job from the EMROwner account.</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>.aws/config 
</code></pre>

<p>Profiles are for parameters, in this case
mostly just needed for the region information, and I need
one for each account because they&rsquo;re in different regions.</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>.aws/credentials
</code></pre>

<p>When AWS says credentials they mean AWS access keys and secret keys,
and they&rsquo;re specific to the account, so you need one set for each.</p>

<p>Note: if you have no region in one of these accounts,
it will fall back to whatever region you had in your default profile,
and that will cause all kinds of weird errors,
none of which say that you’re in the wrong region.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Configuring the S3 buckets:</strong></p>

<p>1) s3://source-data</p>

<p>This bucket is encrypted with a kms key because it
includes GDPR-protected information.</p>

<p>arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111111111:alias/source-data-key</p>

<p>Bucket policy: grants access to both root accounts</p>

<pre><code>{
&quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;, &quot;Statement&quot;: [
    {
    &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;Example permissions&quot;, 
    &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, 
    &quot;Principal&quot;: {
    &quot;AWS&quot;: [ &quot;arn:aws:iam::11111111:root&quot;, 
             &quot;arn:aws:iam::22222222:root&quot;
            ] 
    },
    &quot;Action&quot;: [ &quot;s3:List*&quot;,
                &quot;s3:Get*&quot; ],
    &quot;Resource&quot;: [ &quot;arn:aws:s3:::source-data&quot;, 
                  &quot;arn:aws:s3:::source-data/*&quot;
    ] }
] }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you have to list the bucket and objects separately,
one without the slash + asterisk (that&rsquo;s for the bucket),
and one with the slash + asterisk (that&rsquo;s for the objects in the bucket).
I still find this a strange design choice.</p>

<p>I ended up taking the advice from some friends to try using the most
general List* and Get* because that way I don&rsquo;t have to worry if I&rsquo;m not listing
every individual type of permission I might need.</p>

<p>2)  s3://code-bucket</p>

<p>Owned by the EMRowner account</p>

<p>Where the pyspark code lives,
and where the pyspark logs and processed output will end up.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also added a policy to allow the EMR_EC2_DefaultRole to assume the role I had
created that had access to the s3 bucket (see the next section for a lot more about IAM roles).</p>

<p>So I got that far and I was able to launch my cluster as usual, but I was
getting an Access Denied (403) error on EMR,
or an error saying that the EMR_EC2_DefaultRole can’t
assume the role I created which has access to the s3 bucket.</p>

<p>Note that there are many reasons you can get a 403 error. I don&rsquo;t understand why they are unwilling to
disclose which aspect of your configuration is wrong, except for their security paranoia. I still think
they should give categories of errors to give you some idea of how to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>So I had to backtrack a lot to get a better understanding of how IAM roles actually work.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>IAM roles:</strong></p>

<p>Based on my reading, I reasoned that I could create a role with access
to the bucket, and assume it from the other account.
This seemed like a reasonable approach, although I wasn’t exactly
sure about all the nuances of how it worked.</p>

<p><strong><em>IAM roles can’t actually be layered.</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>“The policies that are attached to the credentials that made 
the original call to AssumeRole are not evaluated by AWS 
when making the &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;deny&quot; authorization decision. 
The user temporarily gives up its original permissions 
in favor of the permissions assigned by the assumed role.“
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>But, IAM roles can be chained:</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>&quot;Role chaining occurs when you use a role to assume a second role 
through the AWS CLI or API. To engage in role chaining, you 
can use RoleA's short-term credentials to assume RoleB.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>After going in circles for a while trying to do everything with the AWS CLI,
I decided to go back to writing unit tests so I could more easily
keep track of what was working and what wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to confirm that I could at least list the bucket
from the EMROwner account, from my machine:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">test_myEMROwner_profile_can_list_s3_bucket</span>(self):

    <span style="color:#66d9ef">assert</span> isinstance (response,  dict)</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, I wanted to make sure I could assume the new roles I had created, and use
those to list the bucket, from my machine:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">role_arn_to_session</span>(profile_name,

<p>If you&rsquo;ve done much with s3, you might already know that just because you can list a bucket, doesn&rsquo;t mean
you can get the objects in it, or read them. So I wrote a test for that.</p>

<pre><code><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">    <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">test_get_object</span>(self):

 I also needed to make sure I could actually access the key:

    </code></pre></div>
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>In the end, I created a new IAM role, let&rsquo;s call it  arn:aws:iam::2222222:role/emr-s3-bucket-role, to
use as the JobFlowRole in my pyspark configuration.</p>

<p>This role has 3 policies:</p>

<p>1) AmazonElasticMapReduceforEC2Role (you don&rsquo;t have to create this one, you just have to add it to the role)</p>

<p>2)  Allow-assume-s3-role (had to create this one)</p>

<pre><code>    {
      &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
      &quot;Statement&quot;: {
        &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,

    &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;sts:AssumeRole&quot;,
        &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:iam::11111111:role/EMR-access-s3&quot;
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>3) Allow-kms-use (also had to create this one)</p>

<pre><code>    {
    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;, 
    &quot;Statement&quot;: [
        {
        &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, 
        &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;kms:*&quot;, 
        &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;
        } ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And I also had to create this trust policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>arn:aws:iam::2222222:user/szeitlin (me, so I can assume it)</li>
<li>The identity provider(s) ec2.amazonaws.com (so EMR can assume it)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><em>Great! That seems like a lot of stuff already. That&rsquo;s probably enough, right?</em></p>

<p>Wrong. Still getting 403 errors. What else do I need?</p>

<hr />

<p>I contacted AWS support and they said the problem is that you can&rsquo;t use a default KMS key with cross-account access
(this is documented in one place, but it&rsquo;s really not made obvious when you&rsquo;re choosing which keys to use).</p>

<p>I was finding that if I logged into my EC2 instance from a failed EMR job, I
could not copy file 00.log.gz from 2018/06/06/ encrypted with
the default key: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:1111111:key/e-uuid</p>

<p>And I could copy, but not read, file 01.log.gz from 2018/06/06 encrypted with
the custom key: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:11111111:key/a-uuid</p>

<p>So that clearly wasn&rsquo;t the whole story.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>EMR Instance Profile:</strong></p>

<p>The Instance Profile is a special thing on EC2. It&rsquo;s basically a container for the IAM role credentials,
which you use to get temporary credentials from the EC2 instance metadata service,
so that your code can access the other AWS services.</p>

<p>The AWS tech support people suggested I should follow these instructions:</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/securely-analyze-data-from-another-aws-account-with-emrfs/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/securely-analyze-data-from-another-aws-account-with-emrfs/</a></p>

<p>1) Create IAM Roles on both accounts (I had already done that)
2) Implement a custom credential provider in java.</p>

<p>I wrote them back and said <em>java? really?</em></p>

<p>And while I was waiting for a response, I went ahead and implemented a way to assume
my IAM roles explicitly from inside my spark job, just to see if that would work.</p>

<p>I decided to try using this (from here: <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/222">https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/222</a>)<br />
with a modified version of the code I already had:</p>

<p>Then use the same code from before for assuming a role,
but this time you&rsquo;re telling the EC2 Instance Profile
to assume the IAM role that has the s3 bucket access</p>

<p>Plus this, so the hadoop user could use the new credentials:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">sc<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>_jsc<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>hadoopConfiguration()<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>set( <span style="color:#e6db74"></span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;fs.s3a.access.key&#39;</span> , creds[ <span style="color:#e6db74"></span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;access_key_id&#39;</span> ])

<p>But I was still getting the same AccessDenied 403 error.</p>

<hr />

<p>AWS finally wrote me back and said I didn&rsquo;t need a custom credential provider,
I should instead just try using SSE-KMS in the security configuration for the EMR cluster.</p>

<p>I had already tried setting up the security configuration for the EMR cluster, but by this point,
the logic of AWS was finally starting to sink in, even though much of their documentation lacks explicit
explanations of why you have to do a thing a specific way:</p>

<p><em>You can&rsquo;t go down in security level.</em></p>

<p>So since I had encryption on the source s3 bucket, that meant I <em>had</em> to
enable the same encryption on the EMR filesystem (EMRFS),
whether I cared about that or not (<em>at this point, I did not care</em>).</p>

<p>The security configuration, in case you&rsquo;ve never used it,
is something you can set up via this obscure tab
on the side of the EMR service window (or via the CLI).</p>

<p>I tried it first with the EMR_EC2_DefaultRole and it gave me an error about not being able to assume itself.
This seems like a bug to me, since the permissions on that role were identical to the one that ultimately worked.</p>

<p>Note that you can’t edit a security configuration, you can only delete and/or create a new one. So I started over and
created a new one with the identical permissions and a different name.</p>

<p>Finally, it worked for the ones with the custom key. (Totally anticlimactic, btw, after all that confusion.)</p>

<hr />

<p>And then, in case you&rsquo;re like me and didn&rsquo;t know this, it turns out that the only way to change the encryption key on
s3 is to re-upload, or copy, the files over again. So the CLI command looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>aws s3 cp s3://source-data/00.log.gz s3://source-data/00.log.gz 
--sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:11111111:alias/a-uuid --profile BucketOwner
</code></pre>

<p>And the boto3 code for that looks something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span>  <span style="color:#a6e22e">re_encrypt_objects</span>(datestring, keyid<span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74"></span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111111111:alias/a-uuid&#39;</span> ):

<hr />

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d say I have one major suggestion for AWS: give us some easier ways to tell which parts of our configurations
are working correctly. Sure, you don&rsquo;t want to give us too many hints if it&rsquo;s a security risk, I can almost understand that
(<em>almost</em>). But almost all of your documentation gives advice on how to do something, with zero advice on how to check
if that step succeeded. It&rsquo;s like writing code with no tests: a recipe for headaches.</p>
