<h2 id="ingesting-clean-data-is-easy-right">Ingesting &ldquo;clean&rdquo; data is easy, right?</h2>
<p>Step 1 of this tutorial began with downloading data using <a href="http://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a>, and saving that to a csv file. So I did that. I&rsquo;ve used requests before, I had no reason to think it wouldn&rsquo;t work. It looked like it worked.</p>
<p>Step 2 was to read the file into pandas. I&rsquo;ve read lots of csv files into pandas before, so I had no reason to think it wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://github.com/szeitlin/labor-force/blob/master/data/0912_2016_census_from_UCI.ipynb">didn&rsquo;t work</a>.</p>
<p>I double-checked that I had followed the instructions correctly, and then checked a few more times before concluding that something was not quite right about the data.</p>
<p>I went back and did the easy thing, just printing out the response from requests.</p>
<p>After some digging, I figured out that <code>response.content</code> is not the same as <code>response.text</code>.</p>
<p>The tutorial said to use <code>response.content</code>, but <code>response.text</code> seemed to have actually parsed the strings.</p>
<p>Even with that fix, pandas was refusing to read in more than the first row of data, due to a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>pandas wasn&rsquo;t finding the line terminators (nothing special, just <code>'\n'</code>)</li>
<li>pandas wasn&rsquo;t finding equal numbers of items per row</li>
</ul>
<p>Unexpectedly, when I went back to what I usually do, just plain old <code>pandas.read_csv</code>, this time going directly from the url, and including the column names, that actually worked.</p>
<p>So it was actually better, and a lot less code, to completely skip using <code>requests</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="testing-always-gets-me-unstuck">Testing always gets me unstuck</h2>
<p>I really liked the end-to-end structure of this tutorial, and was frankly embarrassed that I had so much trouble getting the initial ingestion to work.</p>
<p>I liked that the tutorial gave me an excuse to walk through how the author actually uses scikit-learn models in production. With the data firmly in hand, the data visualization steps were easy - they worked as advertised, and anyway I&rsquo;m very familiar with using <code>seaborn</code> to make charts in python.</p>
<p>I had never created a Bunch object before, so that was new for me. That seemed to work, but then the next steps again failed, and I had to back up a few steps.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the problem was, so I did what I always do with complicated problems, and wrote some <a href="https://github.com/szeitlin/labor-force/blob/master/test_create_bunch.py">tests</a> to rule out user error and make sure I understood what the code was doing. That helped a lot, and identified what was actually broken.</p>
<p>The problem: how to apply <code>LabelEncoder</code> to help convert categorical data, and <code>Imputer</code> to help fill missing data, to multiple columns.</p>
<p>Because the idea was to do this in the context of a <code>Pipeline</code> object, the author demonstrated how to create our own Encoder and Imputer objects, with multiple inheritance. I understand the goal of this: take advantage of the nice clean syntax you get from making a Pipeline. But it was failing at the <code>fit_transform</code> step, and it wasn&rsquo;t obvious why.</p>
<p>The <code>fit()</code> and <code>transform()</code> steps both seemed to be working individually and sequentially, and it wasn&rsquo;t easy to figure out how the <code>fit_transform</code> step was supposed to do anything more than chain them together.</p>
<p>After banging my head on this at the end of a long day, even going back to the original scikit-learn source code in an effort to design tests to help me figure out what was wrong, I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="simple-and-working-is-better-than-complicated-and-broken">Simple and working is better than complicated and broken</h2>
<p>I seriously considered writing tests for our custom Encoder and Imputer objects, but then it dawned on me that I really didn&rsquo;t need to do that. I decided that the Pipeline functionality was so simple that I didn&rsquo;t really need it, so I just stripped the objects down into <a href="https://github.com/szeitlin/labor-force/blob/master/sklearn_categorical.py">simple functions</a> to run the <code>fit</code> and <code>transform</code> steps, which was really all I needed anyway.</p>
<p>That got me through the rest of the steps, so I could practice pickling a model and re-loading it, which seemed to work just fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the scikit-learn folks have plans to extend these methods, or if everyone normally does these kinds of acrobatics to encode and impute on multiple columns - normally I would just use pandas for that, too.</p>
