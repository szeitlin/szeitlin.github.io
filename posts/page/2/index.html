      Am I getting slower every day?
If you&rsquo;ve ever been a bike commuter, you&rsquo;ve probably asked yourself this question. Thanks to these little devices we can now attach to ourselves or our bicycles, we can now use our own actual ride data to investigate these kinds of questions, as well as questions like these:
 If I&rsquo;m going to work from home one day a week, which day would maximize my recovery?

      In continuing my series on investigating bike data, I ran into some interesting aspects of working with device data.
I have some experience with devices, thanks to my many years of working in research labs. This post is about the fun of hunting down what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not.
Things to consider when working with devices  Are you using the device yourself? Are you interacting with the user(s) (directly or indirectly)?

      So I have some bike data that I parsed out of XML and put into a pandas dataframe. Most of the questions I wanted to ask required that the timestamp of each ride segment, or lap, be used as the index along the x-axis of a plot.
Non-obvious nuances of pandas datetime objects and indexes. You have to sort the dataframe by timestamps, before you can convert the timestamps to use as an index.

      One thing I wanted to do with this data set was experiment with plotting methods. I had already done some exploratory plotting with regular matplotlib, so I had some vague ideas about what I wanted to do.
First I had to select out subsets of data to compare. I knew that there were two types of rides: shorter trips in the city, and longer trips in the suburbs. I was feeling lazy, so I just did a quick threshold with SQL.

      One of the main reasons this project turned out to be interesting is that time series data has all kinds of gotchas. I never had to deal with a lot of this before, because the sorts of time series I did in my scientific life didn&rsquo;t care about real-life things like time zones. We mostly just cared about calculating time elapsed.

Anyway one thing I wondered about with the bike data was, can we compare average speeds in the morning vs.

      In an effort to advance my python skills, I spent some time slowly pecking away at the puzzles on pythonchallenge. I got stuck on most of the challenges, and either had to search for a hint, or ask for help from a friend, or both. This latest one was particularly instructive, and it had to do with zipfiles.
I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression.

      I know that from the outside, &lsquo;science&rsquo; seems like The Place Where Scientists Live. But &lsquo;science&rsquo; is not a monolithic, homogenous thing. Not all scientists are the same.
Today someone called me a Biologist. But I was never really a Biologist. My undergraduate degree was in a chemistry department.
My past life as a researcher was always very interdisciplinary. To better understand cancer cells, I used a lot of sophisticated software, and mathematical intuition, in addition to chemistry and physics.

      Once upon a time, a friend recruited me to do some technical writing for the company where he works now. Basically, they needed someone to quickly revise and update the documentation for their software.
Most modern user-friendly software documentation isn&rsquo;t just writing, though. It&rsquo;s screenshots. A LOT of screenshots. So you don&rsquo;t just write &ldquo;click on the blue box&rdquo;, you also show a picture of it, like this. See the blue box?

      I was looking for some fun time series data to hack on. Turns out bike computers provide a great way to interface between your friends&rsquo; unfounded modesty and their actual rides.
One friend was kind enough to donate some data for my entertainment. This friend wears spandex, rides a titanium frame road bike, and sweats a lot. I knew he was a strong cyclist. He&rsquo;s also relatively consistent, which meant the data he gave me wasn&rsquo;t too terribly noisy.
