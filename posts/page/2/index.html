<p>This is one of those posts, I&rsquo;m writing it because I keep hearing people asking the same questions
over and over. I hear these questions at meetups and in Slack groups every week, and I hate seeing people
trying to reinvent the wheel when it&rsquo;s really not necessary.</p>
<h2 id="answer-you-havent-tried-that-hard">Answer: You haven&rsquo;t tried that hard.</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this blog post, let&rsquo;s go with the hypothesis that there are plenty of nontraditional candidates out there
like me. We didn&rsquo;t major in computer science, but we learned how to code and we enjoy it.
We&rsquo;re coming from other kinds of backgrounds. For some of us, this is a second career. We have tons of
transferable skills. You should be hiring more people like us.</p>

      <p>Recently, someone asked for help with setting up postgres in docker and connecting to it with python.</p>
<p>While helping this person, I realized this is something that should be fairly straightforward with a
simple set of instructions, but there aren&rsquo;t a lot good beginner tutorials out there. So I decided
to write this up because I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s something other people would also find useful. A few years ago
I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do this even with a lot of googling (this time I only had to google a few things!).</p>

      <p>I frequently hear Python referred to as a &lsquo;scripting&rsquo; language, because it&rsquo;s not compiled.
Unfortunately, for this reason, a lot of people seem to assume you can&rsquo;t write &lsquo;real&rsquo; programs with it.
This post is about moving beyond using Python as a scripting language. I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re already comfortable with
basic python data types and methods.</p>
<p><em>Note: Most of the content here is specific to Python 3. If you&rsquo;re just learning
Python now, don&rsquo;t learn Python 2, it&rsquo;s being deprecated and many current

      <p>If you do a lot of data pipelining, you&rsquo;ve probably heard a lot about Airflow by now. I gave a talk
about it a while back at a meetup, and wrote a blog post about it. The gist of my pitch for Airflow
was essentially <em>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s so much better than cron.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Fast-forward a year or two, and my team is using Pachyderm now. This post is about why I wanted to try Pachyderm,
what I love about it, some things that can be improved about it, and some of the tricks you&rsquo;ll need to know if you want to start using it.</p>

I had done this before.
But this time, there was a twist: we needed to encrypt the data
because of GDPR requirements.
At the end of the processing, I needed to
save the results to another s3 bucket for loading into Redshift.</p>
<p>Thus began a weeks-long saga of learning about AWS the hard way.</p>

<p>Almost exactly a year ago, I joined <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, which more recently became <a href="https://www.oath.com">Oath</a>.</p>
<p>The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.</p>
<p>Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS. After a while, it made sense to move to <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/">Airflow</a>.</p>
