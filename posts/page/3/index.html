      This post is about a couple of painful problems I&rsquo;ve had with reading in text files.
They&rsquo;re just text files, right? What could be hard about that?
1. Fun with encoding The problem:
A friend sent me a dump of data from iTunes, as a table.
Just a text file.
She&rsquo;s on a Mac. I&rsquo;m on a Mac. But when I went to read in the file, Python choked in a way I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.

      So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re thinking about attending a conference in tech, or some STEM field.
Maybe you&rsquo;ll be going alone. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never been to a conference before, or this conference has a reputation for having, shall we say, &ldquo;a higher risk of harassment&rdquo;.
Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;game plan&rsquo; for things to keep in mind. I&rsquo;m not saying anyone should ever have to do this, I&rsquo;m saying this is more or less what I did when I was younger and had to go to STEM meetings, usually alone, and didn&rsquo;t always feel safe.

      I spent about a year learning Python when I first got back into coding. A lot of people have asked me where to begin. Here&rsquo;s a guide to what I found useful (or not) and why.
 Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-  I started here. I did the free online version.
I like the advice he gives you to just type things in, even if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening yet.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Once upon a time, I looked at a couple of data sets that involved geographical data. I wanted to actually plot the data on a map, so I had to do some shopping around for easy ways to do this quickly with python.
What I wanted to do One of the data sets provided zipcodes, which I was able to convert to latitude and longitude (more on this below). At a minimum, I knew I wanted to be able to plot: a) location, b) a number value and text label, c) multiple colors designating groups of data points, e.

      More than once, and probably not for the last time, I have done a technical interview for which I was underprepared. I feel like no matter how much I try to prepare, I am always underprepared for technical interviews.
I&rsquo;m going to tell you about a time I was underprepared for a few reasons, including:
a) It was the first interview where I was asked to write more than a couple lines of recursive code

      Inspired by a couple of great posts by Michael Gibson, I want to talk about what robustness means to me, as someone coming from a science background.
I started working in a &ldquo;wetlab&rdquo; doing benchwork cancer research when I was in high school (I was 16). I learned early on that mistakes are:
 normal avoidable necessary.  That may sound paradoxical, so I&rsquo;ll explain. Some failures will always happen: the phone rings and you drop something.

      Over the years, I&rsquo;ve attended a lot of technical (read: software) talks. Once upon a time, I attended PyData, at Facebook. I&rsquo;ve noticed at all of these events that the quality of presentations varies widely.
If you&rsquo;re like me, and you go to technical meetups and conferences around the Bay Area, for example, you&rsquo;ll notice that some talks are well-rehearsed.
But some seem like they were thrown together at the last minute.
