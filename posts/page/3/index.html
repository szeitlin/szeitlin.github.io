      In an effort to advance my python skills, I spent some time slowly pecking away at the puzzles on pythonchallenge. I got stuck on most of the challenges, and either had to search for a hint, or ask for help from a friend, or both. This latest one was particularly instructive, and it had to do with zipfiles.
I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression.

      I know that from the outside, &lsquo;science&rsquo; seems like The Place Where Scientists Live. But &lsquo;science&rsquo; is not a monolithic, homogenous thing. Not all scientists are the same.
Today someone called me a Biologist. But I was never really a Biologist. My undergraduate degree was in a chemistry department.
My past life as a researcher was always very interdisciplinary. To better understand cancer cells, I used a lot of sophisticated software, and mathematical intuition, in addition to chemistry and physics.

 The hiring manager contacted me directly He had done his homework. He had looked at my GitHub repos. He told gave me pretty specific information about the structure of the interview, and gave me ~2 weeks to prepare.

      Once upon a time, a friend recruited me to do some technical writing for the company where he works now. Basically, they needed someone to quickly revise and update the documentation for their software.
Most modern user-friendly software documentation isn&rsquo;t just writing, though. It&rsquo;s screenshots. A LOT of screenshots. So you don&rsquo;t just write &ldquo;click on the blue box&rdquo;, you also show a picture of it, like this. See the blue box?

      I was looking for some fun time series data to hack on. Turns out bike computers provide a great way to interface between your friends&rsquo; unfounded modesty and their actual rides.
One friend was kind enough to donate some data for my entertainment. This friend wears spandex, rides a titanium frame road bike, and sweats a lot. I knew he was a strong cyclist. He&rsquo;s also relatively consistent, which meant the data he gave me wasn&rsquo;t too terribly noisy.

      A lot of people have asked me why I&rsquo;m not working in academia or biotech, how I learned to code, or how I got into data science. Here are some answers to some of those questions.
 Are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t rather be in academia?
 Yes and no.
Yes, I wanted my own lab. No, we don&rsquo;t always get what we want, even after 7 years of postdoc.

      This post is about a couple of painful problems I&rsquo;ve had with reading in text files.
They&rsquo;re just text files, right? What could be hard about that?
1. Fun with encoding The problem:
A friend sent me a dump of data from iTunes, as a table.
Just a text file.
She&rsquo;s on a Mac. I&rsquo;m on a Mac. But when I went to read in the file, Python choked in a way I hadn&rsquo;t seen before.

      So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re thinking about attending a conference in tech, or some STEM field.
Maybe you&rsquo;ll be going alone. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never been to a conference before, or this conference has a reputation for having, shall we say, &ldquo;a higher risk of harassment&rdquo;.
Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;game plan&rsquo; for things to keep in mind. I&rsquo;m not saying anyone should ever have to do this, I&rsquo;m saying this is more or less what I did when I was younger and had to go to STEM meetings, usually alone, and didn&rsquo;t always feel safe.

      I spent about a year learning Python when I first got back into coding. A lot of people have asked me where to begin. Here&rsquo;s a guide to what I found useful (or not) and why.
 Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-  I started here. I did the free online version.
I like the advice he gives you to just type things in, even if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening yet.

      Once upon a time, I looked at a couple of data sets that involved geographical data. I wanted to actually plot the data on a map, so I had to do some shopping around for easy ways to do this quickly with python.
What I wanted to do One of the data sets provided zipcodes, which I was able to convert to latitude and longitude (more on this below). At a minimum, I knew I wanted to be able to plot: a) location, b) a number value and text label, c) multiple colors designating groups of data points, e.
