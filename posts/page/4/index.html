<hr>
<ol>
<li>The hiring manager contacted me directly</li>
<li>He had done his homework. He had looked at my GitHub repos.</li>
<li>He told gave me pretty specific information about the structure of the interview, and gave me ~2 weeks to prepare.</li>
<li>The interview was 1-on-1, in person. It lasted 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>The first exercise was to have me go through an app and describe what all the pieces were doing.</li>
<li>The second exercise was to interact with the app and add a feature or two.</li>
<li>The third exercise was to look at a script and identify the bugs (or other problems with it).</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It was an outstanding experience because he had clearly put time and effort into preparing the process, and was patient with understanding that while he knew the app inside and out, I did not.</p>

        FAQ: why and how I learned to code

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>A lot of people have asked me why I&rsquo;m not working in academia or biotech, how I learned to code, or <a href="https://twitter.com/joe3v/status/777278376587333632">how I got into data science</a>. Here are some answers to some of those questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t rather be in academia?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, I wanted my own lab. No, we don&rsquo;t always get what we want, even after 7 years of postdoc.</p>
<p>Long story short: bad timing. It wasn&rsquo;t bad enough that my thesis advisor had some personal and professional crises while I was his first grad student, but one of our lab members committed suicide on September 10th, 2001. I graduated the following year. Then my first postdoc advisor died. Plenty of other things went wrong, but at the end of all that, in spite having <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CtAMtDUAAAAJ">published some papers</a>, I still couldn&rsquo;t get a faculty position.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a &lsquo;game plan&rsquo; for things to keep in mind. I&rsquo;m not saying anyone should ever have to do this,
I&rsquo;m saying this is more or less what I did when I was younger and had to go to STEM meetings, usually alone, and didn&rsquo;t always feel safe.</p>
