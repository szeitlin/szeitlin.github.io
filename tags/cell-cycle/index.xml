      <description>I know that from the outside, &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; seems like The Place Where Scientists Live. But &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; is not a monolithic, homogenous thing.

My undergraduate degree was in a chemistry department.&#xA;My past life as a researcher was always very interdisciplinary. To better understand cancer cells, I used a lot of sophisticated software, and mathematical intuition, in addition to chemistry and physics.</description>
