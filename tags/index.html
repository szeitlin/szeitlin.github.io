      I don&rsquo;t believe truth is a finite value. Truth is what we know right now. Every ten years or so, a major discovery gets overturned. Scientists are just people, and we&rsquo;re wrong a lot.
So one of the scariest things about doing research, or predictions, is trying to convince yourself, and other people, that what you think you&rsquo;ve discovered is &lsquo;real&rsquo;.
Or at least real enough, right now, to be believable.

Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS.

      Why Spark? Lately I have been working on a project that requires cleaning and analyzing a large volume of event-level data.
Originally, I did some exploratory data analysis on small samples of data (up to 15 million rows) using pandas, my usual data visualization tools, and multiprocessing. But then it was time to scale up.
Why Spark is good for this Distributed processing means it&rsquo;s very fast at very large scale, and we can scale it up with minimal adjustments (the same code still works, we just need a bigger cluster).

      Over the years, I&rsquo;ve done a few data science coding challenges for job interviews. My favorite ones included a data set and asked me to address both specific and open-ended questions about that data set.
One of the first things I usually do is make a bunch of histograms. Histograms are great because it&rsquo;s an easy way to look at the distribution of data without having to plot every single point, or get distracted by a lot of noise.

      Airflow for hands-off ETL Almost exactly a year ago, I joined Yahoo, which more recently became Oath.
The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.
Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS.

      Things I learned while following a tutorial on how to build reusable models with scikit-learn.
 When in doubt, go back to pandas. When in doubt, write tests. When in doubt, write helper methods to wrap existing objects, rather than creating new objects.  Ingesting &ldquo;clean&rdquo; data is easy, right? Step 1 of this tutorial began with downloading data using requests, and saving that to a csv file. So I did that.

      When to test, and why: • Write a test for every method.
• Write a test any time you find a bug! Then make sure the test passes after you fix the bug.
• Think of tests as showing how your code should be used, and write them accordingly. The next person who&rsquo;s going to edit your code, or even just use your code, should be able to refer to your tests to see what&rsquo;s happening.

      In an effort to advance my python skills, I spent some time slowly pecking away at the puzzles on pythonchallenge. I got stuck on most of the challenges, and either had to search for a hint, or ask for help from a friend, or both. This latest one was particularly instructive, and it had to do with zipfiles.
I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression.
