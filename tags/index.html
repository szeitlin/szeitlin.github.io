<p>The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.</p>
<p>Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS. After a while, it made sense to move to <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/">Airflow</a>.</p>

<p>• Write a test for every method.</p>

<p>• Think of tests as showing how your code should be used, and write them accordingly. The next person who&rsquo;s going to
edit your code, or even just use your code, should be able to refer to your tests to see what&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>Almost exactly a year ago, I joined <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, which more recently became <a href="https://www.oath.com">Oath</a>.</p>
<p>The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.</p>
<p>Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS. After a while, it made sense to move to <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/">Airflow</a>.</p>

      <p>For better or worse, when you&rsquo;re dealing with data pipelines of varying shapes and sizes, sometimes you need to combine objects that don&rsquo;t match up evenly.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to apply a condition via lookup, sometimes it makes sense to just do a merge. This creates a new column in your data table, and then you can use that for reference.</p>
<p>This is an extremely simple example to show what I mean:</p>

      <p>In continuing my series on <a href="https://szeitlin.github.io/posts/biking_data/biking-data-from-xml-to-plots-revised/">investigating bike data</a>, I ran into some interesting aspects of working with device data.</p>
<p>I have some experience with devices, thanks to my many years of working in research labs. This post is about the fun of hunting down what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-consider-when-working-with-devices">Things to consider when working with devices</h2>
<ol>
<li>Are you using the device yourself?</li>
<li>Are you interacting with the user(s) (directly or indirectly)? Or not at all?</li>
<li>What is the device <em>designed</em> to do? Are you using it for its intended purpose?</li>
<li>How well does the device actually work? Generic measurables might include: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, battery life</li>
<li>What else is being measured?</li>
<li>Measured how?</li>
<li>How are data stored? How much data can it store? How does it connect to other devices/data stores?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of a bike computer, I have been looking at:</p>

      <p>In an effort to advance my python skills, I spent some time slowly pecking away at <a href="http://pythonchallenge.com">the puzzles on pythonchallenge</a>.

<p>I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression. I used various utilities and command-line tools to deal with zipping and unzipping. But I never needed to know how they worked.</p>

      <p>I know that from the outside, &lsquo;science&rsquo; seems like The Place Where Scientists Live. But &lsquo;science&rsquo; is not a monolithic, homogenous thing. Not all scientists are the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today someone called me a <em>Biologist</em>. But I was never really a <em>Biologist</em>. My undergraduate degree was in a chemistry department.</p>
<p>My past life as a researcher was always very interdisciplinary. To better understand cancer cells, I used a lot of sophisticated software, and mathematical intuition, in addition to chemistry and physics.</p>
