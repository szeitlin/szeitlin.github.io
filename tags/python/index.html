      <p><em>The scene:</em></p>
<p>I needed to process data from an s3 bucket using pyspark.
The s3 bucket was owned by a different account.
I had done this before.
But this time, there was a twist: we needed to encrypt the data
because of GDPR requirements.
At the end of the processing, I needed to
save the results to another s3 bucket for loading into Redshift.</p>
<p>Thus began a weeks-long saga of learning about AWS the hard way.</p>

<p>Almost exactly a year ago, I joined <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, which more recently became <a href="https://www.oath.com">Oath</a>.</p>
<p>The team I joined is called the Product Hackers, and we work with large amounts of data. By large amounts I meant, billions of rows of log data.</p>
<p>Our team does both ad-hoc analyses and ongoing machine learning projects. In order to support those efforts, our team had initially written scripts to parse logs and run them with cron to load the data into Redshift on AWS. After a while, it made sense to move to <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/airflow/">Airflow</a>.</p>

<p>One of the first things I usually do is make a bunch of histograms. Histograms are great because it&rsquo;s an easy way to look at the distribution of data without having to plot every single point, or get distracted by a lot of noise.</p>

<p><em>Given a deck of n unique cards, cut the deck c cards from the top and perform a perfect shuffle. A perfect shuffle is where you put down the bottom card from the top portion of the deck followed by the bottom card from the bottom portion of the deck.

<p>• Write a test for every method.</p>
<p>• Write a test any time you find a bug! Then make sure the test passes after you fix the bug.</p>
<p>• Think of tests as showing how your code should be used, and write them accordingly. The next person who&rsquo;s going to
edit your code, or even just use your code, should be able to refer to your tests to see what&rsquo;s happening.</p>

      <p>For better or worse, when you&rsquo;re dealing with data pipelines of varying shapes and sizes, sometimes you need to combine objects that don&rsquo;t match up evenly.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to apply a condition via lookup, sometimes it makes sense to just do a merge. This creates a new column in your data table, and then you can use that for reference.</p>
<p>This is an extremely simple example to show what I mean:</p>

      <p>In an effort to advance my python skills, I spent some time slowly pecking away at <a href="http://pythonchallenge.com">the puzzles on pythonchallenge</a>.

<p>I thought I knew what zip files were. I have used them since grad school, for transferring folders via email, and for compression. I used various utilities and command-line tools to deal with zipping and unzipping. But I never needed to know how they worked.</p>
